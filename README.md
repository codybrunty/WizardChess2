# WizardChess2
Fun multiplayer chess variant.

A Wizard moves like a Queen in regular chess, it cant take any pieces and after it moves it shoots a fireball that destroys a square on the gameboard.
The fireball can be shot in any of the directions like a Queen from the wizard as far as you want without going over another wizard or destroyed square.
