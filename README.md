# WizardChess2
The goal of this project is to create a fun multiplayer chess variant.

A Wizard moves like a Queen in chess but after it moves it shoots a fireball that destroys a square on the gameboard.
The fireball can be shot in any of the directions like a Queen from the wizard as far as you want without going over another wizard or destroyed square.

Video of the current state of the chess game.
